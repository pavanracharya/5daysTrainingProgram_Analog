## 📅 Day 1 – Device-Level Analysis Using Cadence Virtuoso

### Objective
The objective of Day 1 was to gain hands-on exposure to analog IC simulation by analyzing MOSFET behavior through DC, AC, transient, and parametric analyses using Cadence Virtuoso.

---

### Test Circuit Description
A basic NMOS-based test schematic was designed and simulated to study device biasing, small-signal response, and sensitivity to design parameters. The circuit consists of an NMOS transistor with resistive load and DC biasing, driven by an AC input source.

## 1. DC Analysis

DC sweep analysis was performed by varying the input bias voltage while observing the output voltage and operating point parameters of the NMOS transistor.

### Observations
- The NMOS transistor operates in the saturation region for the selected bias range.
- Output voltage remains relatively stable over input bias variations.
- Key parameters such as VGS, VDS, drain current, and transconductance (gm) were verified.

## 2. AC Analysis

Small-signal AC analysis was carried out to evaluate the frequency response of the circuit.

### Observations
- The circuit exhibits finite low-frequency gain.
- Gain roll-off occurs at higher frequencies due to device parasitic capacitances.
- Phase response shows smooth transition without instability.

## 3. Transient Analysis

Transient analysis was performed by applying a sinusoidal input signal to observe the time-domain behavior.

### Observations
- The output waveform follows the input signal with expected amplification.
- No distortion or clipping was observed for the selected input amplitude.
- Confirms correct biasing and linear region operation.

### Transient Response

## 4. Parametric Analysis

Parametric sweep analysis was performed by varying the bias voltage and load resistance to study their impact on output voltage.

### Observations
- Output voltage decreases with increase in load resistance.
- Bias voltage significantly affects the operating point.
- Parametric analysis helps in understanding design sensitivity.
