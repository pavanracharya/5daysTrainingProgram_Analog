Perfect — this is **solid Day-1 work**, and yes, this is absolutely presentable to an external evaluator (Texas / industry level) if we phrase it cleanly and professionally.

Below is a **ready-to-paste Day-1 section** written in **industry-standard, concise, and honest language** (no exaggeration, no student fluff).

## ✅ **Day 1 – Analog IC Fundamentals & Device-Level Analysis**

### **Objective**

To understand basic analog IC design concepts through device-level analysis using Cadence Virtuoso, focusing on MOSFET operation, biasing, and frequency response.

---

### **Tools Used**

* Cadence Virtuoso (ADE L)
* Spectre Simulator

---

### **Circuit Overview**

A basic NMOS-based test schematic was implemented to study DC, AC, transient, and parametric behavior. The circuit was biased using a DC voltage source, and a small-signal AC source was applied at the input to analyze frequency response.

---

### **Analyses Performed**

#### **1. DC Analysis**

* Performed DC sweep of input bias voltage.
* Observed variation of output voltage with respect to input bias.
* Verified that the NMOS operates in the saturation region for the selected bias conditions.
* Key operating parameters such as **VGS**, **VDS**, **ID**, and **gm** were monitored to confirm proper biasing.

**Observation:**
The output voltage remains relatively stable over a range of input bias values, indicating correct bias point selection.

---

#### **2. AC Analysis**

* Small-signal AC analysis was carried out to evaluate frequency response.
* Magnitude and phase plots of **Vout/Vin** were observed.
* Gain roll-off at higher frequencies was identified due to device parasitics.

**Observation:**
The circuit exhibits expected low-frequency gain and a smooth phase transition, confirming small-signal stability.

---

#### **3. Transient Analysis**

* A sinusoidal input signal was applied.
* Time-domain response of input and output voltages was analyzed.
